= PureMvcTestCase

This TestCase class allows testing of PureMVC code through FlexUnit.  The style is intended to mirror EventfulTestCase (another extension to FlexUnit).


== Installation

Installation is easy! Just drop the file into an appropriate directory:
1. Create the following directory structure under your flex project:
    test/org/puremvc/as3/test
2. Copy the file `PureMvcTestCase.as` into this new directory.
3. Ensure that your compiler settings will look in that directory.

You should now be able to import PureMvcTestCase into your test classes.


== How do I use it?

When creating your test class, have it extend PureMvcTestCase.

Here are the methods which are made available:

    * expectNotification(notificationName:String) 
          Sets up the expectation that a notification is sent with the passed name. Can be called multiple times to set the expectation for multiple notifications.
    * assertExpectedNotificationsOccurred(userMessage='') 
          Asserts that all expected notifications were sent. The userMessage parameter indicates an optional message to be prepended for a failure message.
    * lastActualNotification
          Property which represents the last notification which was sent (the last actual notification).


== Example Test Class

The following is an example of the kind of test you can write:

public class ChuckProxyTest extends PureMvcTestCase
{
    private var chuck:ChuckProxy = new ChuckProxy();
 
    public function testShouldSendFlashNotificationWhenSeeingTerrorist():void
    {
        var terrorist:Terrorist = new Terrorist();
        expectNotification(ApplicationFacade.FLASHED);
 
        chuck.lookAt(terrorist);
 
        // asserts FLASHED notification was sent
        assertExpectedNotificationsOccurred();
        // asserts notification body was the terrorist
        assertEquals(terrorist, lastActualNotification.getBody());
    }
}
